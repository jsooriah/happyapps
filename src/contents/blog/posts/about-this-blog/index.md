title: About this blog
description: Blogging helps me reflect on my day to day initiatives at work - product intitiatives, methodologies, interaction with cross functional teams, customers, management, and end users. Being quite fascinated by the human centered design element of things in an excessively digitalized world, I came to realise that most problems encountered by organisations, are ultimately a human problem - lack of alignment, team boundaries, communication, lack of empathy, ..., and the list can be long, ...very long. After some years of experience in the field, I found myself solving these problems, whenever I see teams struggling, I cannot help from finding ways to solve them. As a matter of fact, that's exactly how I transitioned from engineering to product management. Blogging helps me learn while I am writing - whenever I experience the desire to write on something that I believe should be shared to others, I run also some research to support my writings and learn along the way.

How do I run this blog
----------------------

**Open Source Server-Side-Swift & Markdown-Based Static Site Generator**
The last time I pushed code into production was in 2018 and that was on the Apple store and in Swift - Since then I have had in my mind the desire to mingle with some server side swift at some point.
I was more than happy when I discovered Toucan (please make sure to have a look at it) - moreover given the fact that it is markdown based and follows some nice convention over configuration paradigm. 

**LLM based knowledge Management System**
I like the potential of coupling Toucan with an AI writing Assistant working on an LLM based personal knowledge management system. 
Btw this blog is also a journey into AI engineering, leveraging some tools out there to do some cool stuff !
