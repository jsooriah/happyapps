    <description><![CDATA[ The Pragmatist Roots of Agile - John Dewey&#39;s Philosophy and Modern Software Development. When the seventeen software developers gathered at the Snowbird ski resort in Utah in 2001 to draft the Agile Manifesto, they were articulating principles that would revolutionize how teams build software. What they may not have realized is that they were echoing ideas first developed nearly a century earlier by American philosopher and educator John Dewey. The parallels between Dewey&#39;s pragmatist philosophy and agile software development reveal a deeper truth - both represent responses to rigid, theoretical approaches that fail to account for the messy, adaptive nature of real-world problem-solving. ]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[ Don&#39;t go chasing waterfalls and turn the ship around ]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[ Historically, many organisations operated with a waterfall-like model where product managers or business analysts would create detailed specifications that engineers would implement. Engineering teams would receive “clearer guidance upfront” with regular check-ins to ensure alignment. This approach treats engineers primarily as implementers who translate requirements into code. ]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[ As tech people, we’re often eager to build. The excitement of creating something new, something that showcases our technical capabilities and vision, can be intoxicating. But sometimes, our rush to solution-building can blind us to the fundamental question that should drive every product decision:What problem are we really solving? ]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[ The Evolution of UX in the Age of AI - From Interfaces to Intelligence ]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[ Users don’t fundamentally care about your interface — they care about what it helps them accomplish. Nobody opens Photoshop because they love its toolbar; they open it because they need to edit an image. The interface is just the mediator between intention and result. This realization brings us to a critical inflection point - What if our obsession with UI elements has been missing the bigger picture of UX — the holistic user experience? What if AI could help us transcend the limitations of traditional interfaces to focus directly on user outcomes? ]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[ The Silent Kitchen - What Sébastien Bras Reminds Us About Building Products and Teams ]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[ We&#39;ve all absorbed the mythology of the chaotic kitchen—the screaming, the clanging, the barely controlled chaos of a dinner rush. Gordon Ramsay has built an empire on it. &quot;Yes, chef!&quot; shouted at maximum volume. Pans slammed for emphasis. The kitchen as controlled explosion. The brigade system as military operation, with hierarchy enforced through decibels. This mythology is so pervasive that we accept it as the natural state of excellence under pressure. We assume that when stakes are high and standards are higher, chaos is not just inevitable but necessary—the very proof of seriousness, of commitment, of refusing to accept mediocrity. ]]></description>
